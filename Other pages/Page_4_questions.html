		<h1>Some Questions:</h1>

		<h3>1: Who is my target audience? (what group of people am I trying to reach with my website?)</h3>
		<p>I am trying to reach the Heads of the IB curriculum, as well as any people in charge or with influence on the IB curriculum.</p>
		
		<h3>2: What is a static website? (Please explain what it is in your own words, and include an example of such a website)</h3>
		<p>A static website is a website that has a fixed <code>HTML</code> format (such as this one), and does not rely on databases for information, of on specific use-related data (like Facebook or Tumblr).</p>

		<h3>3: Why has the online presence of companies and organizations grown in popularity online in the past 10 years?</h3>
		<p>With the increase in technological advancement, along with the increase of interest in STEM fields, people have been creating more and more websites and such for companies, since the use of advertising online has made newspapers more and more obsolete, therefore making more and more businesses join the online advertising community.</p>

		<h3>4: What is good about having an online presence for organizations to communicate information? How does it benefit the organization?</h3>
		<p>When there is an online presence, hundreds, maybe even thousands of people will be able to see their ads, and therefore bring in more customers. Not to mention the availability to the entire online community</p>

		<h3>5: Why is using a static website for an organization to display information on the web an appropriate choice?</h3>
		<p>Using a static website means that you can access all the information they have at any given moment (while connected to the Internet), and means that anyone can read about your business at any time they want.</p>

		<h3>6: What skills do you need and you will develop through this project? Include both analytical/organizational skills and technical skills.</h3>
