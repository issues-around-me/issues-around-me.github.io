			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<h2>This is a project I am working on for my Grade 9 Design class!</h2>
			<p> This website is still in development, so please excuse any errors. </p>
			<p> Enjoy the site! </p>

		<h1>My first website</h1>
		<p>I use this website very often due to the fact that I simply adore Lord of the Rings, and this provides countless resources that I can use, including some to teach me Elvish.</p><small>Please use your scroll button on your mouse to scroll through the page. Yes, it is navigable!</small></p>
		<!-- The iFrame i mean... iframe. NO I'M NOT OBSESSED WITH APPLE-->
		<div class="wrapper">
		<iframe class="work1" src="http://www.councilofelrond.com/" style="border:none"></iframe>
		</div>
		<!--analysis-->
		<p>This website is very well organized, with tons of pages opening up to hundreds of other links.<br />
		Even though there is a "login" function, that is just for the forum section.<br />
		The website is well designed, with a very appealing layout which is almost directly taken from the books the website is based on. Also, when you refresh the page, there is a new image of a character from the LOTR universe, which is also a very appealing function.<br /> 
		The website is extremely useful, in which there are countless resources, like bookmarks, icons for your desktop, resources to learn Elvish, fonts, and other things from the LOTL universe. <br />
		The website is very easy to use, but one can easily get lost in it, or lose a certain resource, which can be a pain. This has happened to me before, in which I had lost the link to a Sindarin (an elvish dialect) dictionary. <br />
		The website is not the most modern website I've seen, and most of it looks like it was built in the 90s or in the early 2000s, possibly with HTML 3 or 4. It also looks like no one has been updating the website in a while, as stated above, the format looks like HTML 3 or 4, possibly with CSS2. <br />
		The website is perfect for its users (fans of Lord of the Rings), and allows them to access countless resources and chat with other fans if they are logged in.</p>

		<h1>My second website</h1>
		<p>This is a website I found through random Internet searches, and it caught my eye.</p>
		<div class="wrapper">
		<!--Other iframe-->
		<iframe class="work" src="https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic" style="border:none"></iframe>
		</div>
		<p>This website is very minimalist, and is probably built using Bootstrap (a form of CSS used to make designing a page easier) It is very easy to look at, and offers a very nice mix of colors and different shades of those colors. There are also many animations throughout the page, which are very pleasing to the eye.
		The website (and specifically the Animations) work through a series of <code>div</code> elements, as seen below: </p>
		<img src="../Images/InspectingWasteTime2.PNG" alt="Div explanation" style="width:100%"/>
		<p>Here, you can see that each section has a certain <code>div</code> element, and if you expand each one:</p>
		<img src="../Images/InspectingWasteTime.PNG" alt="Epanded Div explanation" style="width:100%"/>
		<p>This would have taken a very long time to build, and the use of Bootstrap is evident.<br />
		The website uses the information it provides as a simple way to advertise a program about how to focus more at work, and uses a timer (probably made with JavaScript) and works very well, considering that people most likely went on it as a form of distraction. The link at the bottom of the page takes you to a software advertising its ability to improve team organization and such <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" teaget="_blank">(Click here to see)</a>.<br />
		The website, when opened in its native form, is a bit difficult to read, since only a small amount of the page is shown at a time. This is not very ergonomic, and puts readers with reading disabilities at a large disadvantage.<br />
		It is very modern-looking, and although it is difficult to find if you are not looking for it, 
		The website is exemplary for its audience, which is most likely anyone in a workplace with access to the Internet. It provides useful, statistical, and trustworthy information that proves a good point (people waste time in the workplace).<br /></p>
