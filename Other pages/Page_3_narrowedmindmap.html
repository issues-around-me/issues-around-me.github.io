		<h1>The topic I have chosen is:</h1>
		<h2>The lack of enthusiasm and/or the lack of availability for STEM subjects other than Mathematics and Sciences</h2>
		<p><p><q>Founded in 1968, the International Baccalaureate® (IB) is a non-profit educational foundation offering four highly respected programs of international education that develop the intellectual, personal, emotional and social skills needed to live, learn and work in a rapidly globalizing world. Schools must be authorized, by the IB organization, to offer any of the programs. To learn about the authorization process, visit our Become an IB World School section. The IB has a hard-earned reputation for high standards of teaching, pedagogical leadership and student achievement. We work with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programs of international education and rigorous assessment.</q> - That is what the "About the IB" section of the IB page reads. <br />
		Simply stated, it means that th IB is a collection of programs that develop skills that are needed in a rapidly changing world<br />
		However, there is a small problem: No school system is perfect.<br />
		That is why I have chosen this issue.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		As a student in the IB, and as one interested in Computer Sciences, and possibly taking said Computer Science class(es) in university, imagine my surprise when my school (ISL Qatar) does not (as of the time of publication) offer Computer science courses in the Diploma Program of the IB.<br />
		Some (My mother) might say that I could simply take Higher Level Mathematics, or Extended Higher Level Mathematics, along with Physics, in order to make up for the lack of a Computer Science course. <br />
		Simply put, that won't work. Physics and even Extended Higher Level Mathematics do not come close to the requirements for the Computer Science course (<a href="WC.html">Sources</a>), which requires the students to learn a CODING LANGUAGE which neither Physics nor Chemistry nor any level of Math nor any other subject in the IB curriculum  offers. Hence, if I do take university level Computer Science, then I will be put at a serious disadvantage.<br />
		You may be wondering<q>Well, this boy put his presentation into a website, about a website, isn't that enough coding knowledge?</q> The answer is NO. If one were to learn how to code in a specific coding language, and be examined on it, then that person would have a great amount of knowledge compared to someone who gathered all their knowledge online.</p></p>
